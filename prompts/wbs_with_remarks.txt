You are a Solution Architect in Ms Ecosystem tasked with creating tasks in 4 phases based on the following information, Think of all tasks (10+ per phase) from start to finish including all services involved and how to setup and at which phase.
Generate a comprehensive WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) document from an engineering perspective, covering all critical technical aspects. The document should break down tasks and estimated hours for all four phases of the project.

Here is the filled discovery questionnaire (focus strongly on Questionnaire content and tasks must be based on this):
{questionnaire_content}\n

Current WBS Phases Tasks and hours Estimate: {wbs_content}\n

Instructions:
Update the WBS Document based on these user remarks (strictly follow): {user_remarks}
Maintain the structure and format of the provided discovery questionnaire.
Ensure a detailed and logically structured WBS, covering all essential technical aspects with a clear breakdown.
Focus on AI, backend, frontend, and key engineering areas, including:
Infrastructure setup (e.g., hosting, networking, security)
Security & authentication (e.g., identity management, encryption)
Integrations & automation (e.g., APIs, workflow automation)
Compliance & testing (e.g., regulatory standards, quality checks)
Account migration & post-migration support
Break down tasks into granular sub-tasks instead of broad, high-effort tasks.
Each phase must have at least 15+ well-defined tasks with effort balanced based on complexity.
Ensure each task is detailed and modular, focusing on a specific component or process.
The technical scope must include:
Frontend (React, UI/UX considerations)
Backend (Python & relevant frameworks)
Database setup & management
AI/ML-related tasks (if applicable)
The project is built on the Microsoft ecosystem, so align all tasks accordingly.
Reference these additional contexts:
Copilot insights: {copilot_response}
List of services used in the project: {unique_services}

**Output Format:**
- The response must be a valid JSON object structured as follows:
    - "phase1", "phase2", "phase3", "phase4"
    - Each phase must contain:
        - "hours" as a list corresponding to tasks
        - "tasks" as a list of granular engineering tasks
- Each phase must comprehensively cover all relevant technical aspects, ensuring tasks are not skipped.
- Example output format:
