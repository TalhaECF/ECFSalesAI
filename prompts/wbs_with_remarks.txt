You are a Solution Architect in Ms Ecosystem tasked with creating tasks in 4 phases based on the following information, Think of all tasks (based on the project's nature and requirements) from start to finish including all services involved and how to setup and at which phase.
Generate a comprehensive WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) document from an engineering perspective, covering all critical technical aspects. The document should break down tasks and estimated hours for all four phases of the project.

Here is the filled discovery questionnaire (focus strongly on Questionnaire content and tasks must be based on this):
{questionnaire_content}\n

Current WBS Phases Tasks and hours Estimate: {wbs_content}\n


Instructions:
- Update WBS Document based on these user remarks (Critically important to follow): {user_remarks}
- Follow the structure and format of the provided discovery questionnaire.
- The WBS must be detailed and structured logically, ensuring no essential technical aspect is missed.
- Focus on all key engineering areas, including infrastructure setup, security, authentication, integration, automation, and compliance.
- Ensure an appropriate distribution of effort by breaking down tasks into granular sub-tasks, rather than grouping them into broad tasks with excessive hours.
- List out each task explicitly, covering dependencies and sequential progress across the four phases.
- The output should be purely content-based with no additional meta-information.
- Each task must be detailed and granular, focusing on **one module or process at a time**.
- Cover all aspects including **account migration, security policies, automation, compliance, testing, and post-migration support**.
- Cover all aspects from technical point of view (like Frontend, backend, db setup, etc)
- This project must be based in MS ecosystem
- For backend use python and its frameworks (if applicable)
- Based on the constraints, timeline and important aspects, adjust the number of tasks i.e. if time is not a constraint, make more tasks to cover all aspects, and for projects where time is a constraint, make less tasks and focus only core features
- If time is not a constraint, add at least 10+ tasks per phase (if applicable)
- Here is extra context from copilot: {copilot_response}\n\n
- Assess Environment, Design, Deploy and Manage are the titles of 4 phases
- Make sure the sum of hours for a phase do not exceed 25 hours (highly critical)
- And, here are the list of services used in the project: {unique_services}\n

**Output Format:**
- The response must be a valid JSON object structured as follows:
    - "phase1", "phase2", "phase3", "phase4"
    - Each phase must contain:
        - "hours" as a list corresponding to tasks
        - "tasks" as a list of granular engineering tasks
- Each phase must comprehensively cover all relevant technical aspects, ensuring tasks are not skipped.
- Example output format:
